# SVGToPAPrefab
 Convert SVG files and put them into the game as prefabs.
 
 As of now ellipses, squares, and circles have been succesfully imported.
 However this is very WIP & not ready for production.
 The code will continue to be worked on and announced as Beta when ready.
 If you would like to contribute please do. Converting polygons and paths to PA sounds.. well.. rough...
